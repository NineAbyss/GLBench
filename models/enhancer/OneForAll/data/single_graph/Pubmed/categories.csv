Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental is a category of scientific literature found on PubMed that encompasses research related to experimental studies on diabetes mellitus. This category includes studies conducted in laboratory settings, often using animal models or cell cultures, to investigate various aspects of diabetes, such as its pathophysiology, treatment strategies, and potential interventions. Researchers in this field aim to better understand the underlying mechanisms of diabetes and develop experimental approaches to prevent or manage the disease. Experimental studies in this category may explore topics like insulin resistance, beta cell function, glucose metabolism, and the development of novel therapies for diabetes.
The PubMed literature category 'Diabetes Mellitus Type 1' focuses on scientific research related specifically to Type 1 diabetes mellitus. This category encompasses a wide range of studies, including clinical trials, epidemiological investigations, and basic research, all centered on understanding, diagnosing, managing, and potentially curing Type 1 diabetes. Researchers in this field explore areas such as the autoimmune processes underlying the disease, insulin therapy, glucose monitoring, pancreatic islet transplantation, and novel treatments aimed at improving the lives of individuals with Type 1 diabetes. It serves as a valuable resource for healthcare professionals, scientists, and policymakers interested in advancements related to Type 1 diabetes management and research.
The PubMed category 'Diabetes Mellitus Type 2' focuses on research related to Type 2 diabetes (T2D), and it can be differentiated from Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 (T1D) in the following ways: Etiology (Cause): Type 2 Diabetes (T2D): T2D is primarily characterized by insulin resistance, where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin, and relative insulin deficiency that develops over time. It is not primarily an autoimmune condition.
